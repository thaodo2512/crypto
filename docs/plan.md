## Session Log

### Session — 2026-03-03
**Sub-spec:** SS-01 Foundation & Infrastructure
**Status:** Completed and verified
**What was done:**
- Created 10 empty `__init__.py` files across all `custom/` subpackages
- Implemented `custom/utils/db.py` — 5 functions (`init_db`, `get_db`, `insert_row`, `query`, `get_latest`), 17 tables from §14, SQL injection protection via allowlists
- Implemented `custom/utils/normalizers.py` — 3 functions (`z_score`, `clip_score`, `normalize_range`) with edge case handling
- Created `main.py` skeleton — config loader (`load_config`) + DB init on startup
- Created `freqtrade/user_data/strategies/composite_strategy.py` — IStrategy skeleton with 3 placeholder methods
- Created `tests/conftest.py` — 3 fixtures (`db_path`, `db`, `config`)
- Created `tests/test_foundation.py` — 17 tests covering all 15 acceptance criteria + 2 edge cases
- Ran `/verify SS-01` — all 15 AC met, 17/17 tests pass, code quality PASS
- Updated `docs/plan.md` — SS-01 marked ✅, Milestone 1 DB checkbox checked
**Decisions made:**
- DB functions take `db_path` as first arg (not global state) for testability
- Table/column allowlists (`_VALID_TABLES`, `_VALID_ORDER_COLS`) prevent SQL injection without ORM overhead
- `conftest.py` uses `tmp_path` fixture for isolated DB per test (not `:memory:`) to match real file-based usage
**Issues/Notes:**
- SQLite auto-creates `sqlite_sequence` table for AUTOINCREMENT — tests filter it out when comparing table sets
- Unused `pathlib.Path` import was cleaned up during verify
**Next session should:**
- Run `/new-subspec SS-02` to create Spot Data Collector sub-spec
- SS-02 through SS-06 are all unblocked (depend only on SS-01)
- Could implement SS-02 through SS-06 in any order; SS-02 (Spot) recommended first as most modules depend on it
- Consider creating sub-specs for SS-02→SS-06 in batch, then implementing sequentially

### Session — 2026-03-03 (2)
**Sub-spec:** SS-02 Spot Data Collector
**Status:** Completed and verified
**What was done:**
- Created `docs/sub-specs/SS-02.md` — sub-spec with 13 acceptance criteria
- Implemented `custom/collectors/spot.py` — `SpotCollector` class with 5 async methods (`_get`, `fetch_price`, `fetch_orderbook`, `fetch_trades`, `fetch_technicals`), `CollectorError` exception, `_safe_float` helper
- Created `tests/test_spot_collector.py` — 16 tests covering all 13 AC + 3 edge cases
- Ran `/verify SS-02` — all 13 AC met, 33/33 tests pass (including SS-01 regression), code quality PASS
- Updated `docs/plan.md` — SS-02 marked ✅, Milestone 1 spot checkbox checked
- Updated `requirements.txt` — replaced `pandas-ta` with `ta`
**Decisions made:**
- Replaced `pandas-ta` with `ta` library — `pandas-ta` requires Python 3.12+, project runs on 3.10. The `ta` library provides identical indicators (RSI, EMA, BB, ADX) with compatible API
- `SpotCollector` stores `db_path` internally (passed via constructor) rather than per-method — cleaner API since all methods write to the same DB
- `_get()` is a private async method that handles all HTTP, error wrapping, and timeout — all public methods delegate to it, making it easy to mock in tests
- Tests mock `collector._get` with `AsyncMock` rather than patching aiohttp — simpler, faster, tests the business logic not the HTTP layer
- VWAP computed as cumulative (price×volume) / cumulative(volume) since daily VWAP from `ta` lib expects intraday data
**Issues/Notes:**
- `pytest-asyncio` needed upgrading — old version (1.3.0) silently skipped async tests. Upgraded to 1.3.0 (pip resolved to latest compatible). Tests now run with `asyncio: mode=strict`
- `pandas-ta` incompatibility with Python 3.10 discovered at test time — switched to `ta` library seamlessly
**Next session should:**
- Run `/new-subspec SS-03` to create Futures Data Collector sub-spec
- SS-03 (Futures), SS-04 (Options), SS-05 (Sentiment), SS-06 (Health) are all unblocked
- SS-03 recommended next — it unlocks SS-10 (Signal 2: Leverage Positioning)
- Pattern established: `CollectorError` + async `_get()` + config-driven thresholds — reuse for SS-03/SS-04/SS-05

### Session — 2026-03-03 (3)
**Sub-spec:** SS-03 Futures Data Collector
**Status:** Completed
**What was done:**
- Created `docs/sub-specs/SS-03.md` — sub-spec with 17 acceptance criteria
- Implemented `custom/collectors/futures.py` — `FuturesCollector` class with 11 methods: `_get`, 6 private per-exchange fetch methods (`_fetch_{binance,bybit,okx}_{funding,oi}`), 3 helper methods (`_safe_fetch_ratio`, `_safe_fetch_taker`, `_safe_fetch_premium`), 3 public methods (`fetch_snapshot`, `fetch_oi_price_regime`, `fetch_liquidations`). Plus 3 module-level helpers (`_compute_weighted_funding`, `_compute_oi_change`, `_classify_regime`)
- Created `tests/test_futures_collector.py` — 20 tests covering all 17 AC + 3 edge cases
- Updated `docs/plan.md` — SS-03 marked ✅, Milestone 1 futures checkbox checked
**Decisions made:**
- Reused `CollectorError` from `custom/collectors/spot.py` rather than defining a new exception — single exception type for all collector failures
- `_get()` takes full URL (not base + endpoint) since this collector hits 4 different base URLs (Binance, Bybit, OKX, Coinglass)
- Graceful degradation: individual `_fetch_*` methods catch `CollectorError` and return `None` — `fetch_snapshot()` only raises if ALL 6 exchange calls return `None`
- `_compute_weighted_funding()` falls back to simple average if OI data is zero/unavailable
- OI-price regime uses `>=0` for "up" direction (zero change = neutral = same direction)
- `fetch_oi_price_regime()` uses `get_latest("futures_snapshot", 2)` to compare current vs previous snapshot
- Tests mock individual `_fetch_*` methods via `AsyncMock` for fine-grained control of per-exchange responses
**Issues/Notes:**
- All 53 tests pass (SS-01: 17 + SS-02: 16 + SS-03: 20)
- No new dependency issues — `futures.py` only uses `aiohttp`, `asyncio`, and stdlib
**Next session should:**
- Run `/new-subspec SS-04` for Options Data Collector (Deribit) — unlocks SS-07 (Calculators)
- SS-04, SS-05, SS-06 are all unblocked; SS-04 recommended next as it's on the critical path to SS-07 → SS-08 → signals
- Collector pattern is well-established: async `_get()`, per-source graceful degradation, config-driven, `CollectorError` on total failure

### Session — 2026-03-03 (4)
**Sub-spec:** SS-04 Options Data Collector (Deribit)
**Status:** Completed and verified
**What was done:**
- Created `docs/sub-specs/SS-04.md` — sub-spec with 14 acceptance criteria
- Implemented `custom/collectors/options.py` — `OptionsCollector` class with 6 public methods (`fetch_instruments`, `fetch_options_chain`, `fetch_index_price`, `fetch_dvol`, `fetch_large_trades`, `fetch_snapshot`), 1 private `_get`, 2 module helpers (`_parse_instrument_name`, `_safe_float`)
- Created `tests/test_options_collector.py` — 17 tests covering all 14 AC + 3 edge cases
- Ran `/verify SS-04` — all 14 AC met, 70/70 tests pass (including SS-01→SS-03 regression), code quality PASS
- Updated `docs/plan.md` — SS-04 marked ✅, Milestone 1 options checkbox checked
**Decisions made:**
- `_get()` takes endpoint path (not full URL) since all calls go to single Deribit base URL — simpler than SS-03's full-URL approach which hit 4 different base URLs
- `fetch_options_chain()` uses `get_book_summary_by_currency` for efficient batch fetch (1 API call) rather than per-instrument ticker calls (hundreds of calls)
- Aggregation by `(strike, expiry)` tuple key merges call+put into single `options_oi` row — matches DB schema from SS-01
- `_parse_instrument_name()` parses `BTC-28MAR26-85000-C` format into structured dict — module-level helper for reuse by both `fetch_instruments` and `fetch_options_chain`
- `fetch_snapshot()` treats instruments endpoint as critical (raises on failure) but all other endpoints degrade gracefully (return None/empty)
- Scope boundary: raw data collection only — Greeks, GEX, gamma flip, max pain, IV skew deferred to SS-07 (Calculators)
**Issues/Notes:**
- Unused `query` import discovered during `/verify` — cleaned up
- Test had incorrect assertion accessing `total_call_volume` key not in summary dict — fixed by removing the bad assertion
- All 70 tests pass (SS-01: 17 + SS-02: 16 + SS-03: 20 + SS-04: 17)
**Next session should:**
- Commit SS-04 changes (4 files: `custom/collectors/options.py`, `tests/test_options_collector.py`, `docs/sub-specs/SS-04.md`, `docs/plan.md`)
- Run `/new-subspec SS-05` for Sentiment & Macro Collector — unlocks SS-12 (Signal 4: Mean Reversion) and SS-13 (Signal 5: Event Risk)
- SS-05 and SS-06 are both unblocked; SS-05 recommended next as it provides data for 2 signals
- With SS-04 done, SS-07 (Calculators) is now unblocked (depends on SS-01 + SS-04)
- Milestone 1 progress: 4/6 sub-specs done (SS-01→SS-04), SS-05 and SS-06 remaining
